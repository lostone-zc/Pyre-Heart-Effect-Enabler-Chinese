## How to manually install:
1. Install BepInEx 5.4 (or you can use the preconfigured ones)
2. Run the game onces (To initialize BepInEx for first time)
3. Put the mod into (gamedata)\BepInEx\plugins
4. Restart the game (If the mod does not shows, check the game logs if there's Patty_PyreHeartEffectEnabler_MOD installed and if BepInEx is installed correctly).
5. It's highly recommended (but still optional) to install BepInEx Configuration Manager﻿ as this makes enabling and disabling certain Pyre Heart effects a whole lot easier.

## How to use (if you have BepInEx Configuration Manager):
- Press F1 to open the configuration menu.
- On the Pyre Heart Effect Enabler, enable/disable any Pyre Heart effect you want. By default everything is enabled.
- Hover into the options to see the description of what it does (some might not have description)
- Start a new run to see the changes

## How to use (if you don't have it):
- After running the game onces. Go to BepInEx/cfg. Open the file called Patty_PyreHeartEffectEnabler_MOD.cfg
- Set any Pyre Heart Effect you want to true (to enable) and false (to disable)
- If you have the game running right now, please restart the game
- Start a new run to see the changes
